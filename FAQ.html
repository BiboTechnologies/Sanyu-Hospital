    <p>If you’re not pregnant, your period may be late due to a great deal of stress or low body weight. Certain conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diabetes, and others, can also affect your menstrual cycle.</p>

    <h3>Common Causes of Delayed Periods:</h3>
    <ol>

        <!-- Include information about stress and its impact on the menstrual cycle -->

        <li><strong>Low Body Weight:</strong> People with eating disorders may experience irregularities in their cycle. Losing too much weight can cause irregular periods and may even stop your cycle altogether.</li>

        <li><strong>Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI):</strong> Those experiencing symptoms of menopause around age 40 or earlier may have POI. It can arise from various causes, including genetic disorders and autoimmune conditions.</li>
        <!-- Include information about POI and its causes -->

        <li><strong>Thyroid Issues:</strong> An overactive or underactive thyroid gland can be the cause of late or missed periods. Thyroid issues can usually be treated with medication.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Research shows that the prevalence of irregular menstrual cycles is 5-35.6% depending on your age, occupation, and where you live. Irregularities can also occur during the first period and during the menopause transition.</p>

    Chest pain
</div>

<!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="chestPainDetails" style="display: none;">
    <h2>Chest pain</h2>
    <p>Chest pain appears in many forms, ranging from a sharp stab to a dull ache. Sometimes chest pain feels crushing or burning. In certain cases, the pain travels up the neck and into the jaw and then spreads to the back or down one or both arms.</p>

    <p>Many different problems can cause chest pain. The most life-threatening causes involve the heart or lungs. Because chest pain can be due to a serious problem, it's important to seek immediate medical help.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Chest pain can feel different depending on what's triggering the symptom. Often, the cause has nothing to do with the heart — though there's no easy way to tell without seeing a health care provider.</p>

    <h4>Heart-related chest pain</h4>
    <p>Chest pain is often associated with heart disease. But many people with heart disease say they have a mild discomfort that they wouldn't really call pain. Chest discomfort due to a heart attack or another heart problem may feel like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pressure, fullness, burning, or tightness in the chest.</li>
        <li>Crushing or searing pain that spreads to the back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms.</li>
        <li>Pain that lasts more than a few minutes, gets worse with activity, goes away and comes back, or varies in intensity.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
        <li>Cold sweats.</li>
        <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness.</li>
        <li>Racing heartbeats.</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Other types of chest pain</h4>
    <p>It can be difficult to tell if chest pain is related to the heart or caused by something else. Usually, chest pain is less likely due to a heart problem if it happens with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A sour taste or a sensation of food reentering the mouth.</li>
        <li>Trouble swallowing.</li>
        <li>Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position.</li>
        <li>Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough.</li>
        <li>Tenderness when you push on your chest.</li>
        <li>Pain that continues for many hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The classic symptoms of heartburn — a painful, burning sensation behind the breastbone — can be caused by problems with the heart or the stomach.</p>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Chest pain has many possible causes, all of which need medical care.</p>

    <h4>Heart-related causes</h4>
    <p>Examples of heart-related causes of chest pain include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angina. This is chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart.</li>
        <li>Heart attack. A heart attack results from blocked blood flow to the heart muscle.</li>
        <li>Aortic dissection. This life-threatening condition involves the main artery leading from the heart.</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the sac around the heart, called pericarditis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Digestive causes</h4>
    <p>Chest pain can be caused by disorders of the digestive system, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heartburn. This is a painful, burning feeling behind the breastbone.</li>
        <li>Swallowing disorders. Problems with the esophagus can make swallowing difficult and even painful.</li>
        <li>Gallbladder or pancreas problems. Gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas can cause stomach pain that spreads to the chest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Muscle and bone causes</h4>
    <p>Some types of chest pain are associated with injuries and other problems affecting the structures that make up the chest wall.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Costochondritis. In this condition, the cartilage of the rib cage becomes inflamed and painful.</li>
        <li>Sore muscles. Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, may cause long-term pain that affects the chest muscles.</li>
        <li>Injured ribs. A bruised or broken rib can cause chest pain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Lung-related causes</h4>
    <p>Many lung problems can cause chest pain, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A blood clot in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism.</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the membrane covering the lungs, called pleurisy.</li>
        <li>Collapsed lung.</li>
        <li>High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Other causes</h4>
    <p>Chest pain also can be caused by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Panic attack. Seek medical help if you aren't sure of the cause of chest pain.</li>
        <li>Shingles. This condition can cause intense pain and a band of blisters from the back around to the chest area.</li>
    </ul>

<div id="erectileDysfunctionDetails" style="display: none;">
    <h2>Erectile dysfunction</h2>
    <p>Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is very common, particularly in men over 40. It's usually nothing to worry about, but see a GP if it keeps happening.</p>

    <h3>What is erectile dysfunction?</h3>
    <p>Erectile dysfunction is when you are either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unable to get an erection.</li>
        <li>Unable to keep an erection for long enough to have sex.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on the cause, you may still be able to get an erection at other times, such as when you wake up. Sometimes you might also have low sex drive (loss of libido).</p>

    <h3>Causes of erectile dysfunction</h3>
    <p>Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection. This is usually caused by stress, tiredness, or drinking too much alcohol, and it's nothing to worry about. It can also be a side effect of some medicines.</p>
    <p>If erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High blood pressure or high cholesterol.</li>
        <li>Diabetes.</li>
        <li>Depression or anxiety.</li>
        <li>Hormone problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things you can do to help with erectile dysfunction</h3>
    <p>Healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction.</p>
    <h4>Do:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Lose weight if you're overweight.</li>
        <li>Stop smoking.</li>
        <li>Eat a healthy diet.</li>
        <li>Exercise daily.</li>
        <li>Try to reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Don't:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week.</li>
        <li>Do not cycle for a while, if you cycle for more than 3 hours a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Non-urgent advice:</h3>
    <p>See a GP or go to a sexual health clinic if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Erection problems keep happening. It might be a sign of a health condition that can be treated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information:</h3>
    <p>How sexual health clinics can help with erection problems</p>
    <p>Sexual health clinics treat problems with sexual health. They can provide the same treatment you would get at your GP surgery. Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment. They'll often get test results quicker than GP practices.</p>
    <p>Find a sexual health clinic near you</p>

    <h3>What happens at your appointment</h3>
    <p>If you see someone about erectile dysfunction, the doctor or nurse may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask about your lifestyle and relationships, and any problems you might be having.</li>
        <li>Do some basic health checks, such as taking your blood pressure.</li>
        <li>Examine your genitals to rule out any obvious physical cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have symptoms like needing to pee more often than usual, you may also have an examination of your prostate (rectal examination).</p>

    <h3>Treatments for erectile dysfunction</h3>
    <p>Treatment can usually help improve erectile dysfunction.</p>

    <h4>Medicines for erectile dysfunction</h4>
    <p>The main treatments are medicines that increase the blood flow to your penis, called PDE-5 inhibitors. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sildenafil (Viagra)</li>
        <li>Tadalafil (Cialis)</li>
        <li>Vardenafil (Levitra)</li>
        <li>Avanafil (Spedra)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get sildenafil on prescription or you can buy it from a pharmacy. You need a prescription for the other types.</p>

    <h4>Buying Viagra online</h4>
    <p>...</p> <!-- Add content for Buying Viagra online here -->

    <h4>Vacuum pumps</h4>
    <p>Vacuum pumps encourage blood to flow to the penis, causing an erection. They work for most men and can be used if medicine is not suitable or does not work. They're not always available on the NHS. Speak to a doctor about where to get a vacuum pump.</p>

    <h4>Treating the cause of erectile dysfunction</h4>
    <p>There are also treatments for some of the causes of erectile dysfunction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your doctor may switch you to a different medicine if it's causing your erectile dysfunction.</li>
        <li>High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and hormone problems may be treated with medicine.</li>
        <li>Counselling and therapy can help if your erection problems are linked to emotional or mental health problems – but there can be a long wait for these services on the NHS.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="backPainDetails" style="display: none;">
    <p>Back pain is one of the most common medical problems in the United States. It can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that may shoot down the leg. Sometimes it can come on suddenly – from an accident, a fall, or lifting something heavy, or it can develop slowly because of age-related degenerative changes in the spine. In some cases, inflammatory arthritis disorders or other medical conditions cause back pain.</p>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>Treatment varies depending on the cause and symptoms, and often there are several contributing factors. However, there are steps you can take to improve your health and lower your chance of developing chronic or long-lasting back pain.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Treatment here -->

    <h3>Understanding the Anatomy of the Back</h3>
    <p>There are many different structures in the anatomy of the back that work together to support your body. Problems with any one of these structures can cause back pain.</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Parts of the spine and back include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Vertebrae – small bones stacked on top of one another, which protect the spinal cord.</li>
        <li>Spinal cord – long bundle of nerves that run down the back through a canal in the vertebrae.</li>

    Diabetes
</div>

<!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="diabetesDetails" style="display: none;">
    <p>Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.</p>

    <h3>The main cause of diabetes</h3>
    <p>The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for The main cause of diabetes here -->

    <h3>Chronic diabetes conditions</h3>
    <p>Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Chronic diabetes conditions here -->

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes, or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Symptoms here -->

    <h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
    <p>If you think you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for When to see a doctor here -->

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Causes here -->

    <h3>Risk factors</h3>
    <p>Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Family history may play a part in all types. Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Risk factors here -->

    <h3>Complications</h3>
    <p>Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Complications here -->

    <h3>Complications of gestational diabetes</h3>
    <p>Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Complications of gestational diabetes here -->

    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Prevention here -->

    <p>Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored.</p>
    <p>Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day.</p>
    <p>Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Prevention (continued) here -->

    <p>Sometimes drugs are an option. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. But healthy lifestyle choices are important. If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.</p>

    Hypertension / pressure
</div>

<!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="hypertensionDetails" style="display: none;">
    <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) has no symptoms and can be dangerous if not treated. Hypertension puts you at risk for stroke, heart attack, and other problems. Nearly half of adults who have hypertension don’t realize it. So, checkups are crucial. Dietary changes, exercise, and medicine can help you keep your blood pressure where it should be.</p>

    <h3>What is high blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>High blood pressure is when the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is consistently too high. This damages your arteries over time and can lead to serious complications like heart attack and stroke. “Hypertension” is another word for this common condition.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for What is high blood pressure? here -->

    <h3>How do I know if I have high blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Getting your blood pressure checked is the only way to know if it’s too high. You can do this by seeing a healthcare provider for a yearly checkup, even if you feel healthy. You won’t feel sick if you have high blood pressure. So, these checkups are crucial and can be life-saving.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for How do I know if I have high blood pressure? here -->

    <h3>What is considered high blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Definitions of high blood pressure vary slightly depending on where you live. In the U.S., healthcare providers define high blood pressure (hypertension) as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A top number (systolic blood pressure) of at least 130 mmHg, and/or</li>
        <li>A bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) of at least 80 mmHg.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for What is considered high blood pressure? here -->

    <h3>How common is high blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>High blood pressure is very common. It affects 47% of adults in the U.S. This equals about 116 million people. Of those, 37 million have a blood pressure of at least 140/90 mmHg.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for How common is high blood pressure? here -->

    <h3>Symptoms and Causes</h3>
    <p>Usually, high blood pressure causes no signs or symptoms. That’s why healthcare providers call it a “silent killer.” You could have high blood pressure for years and not know it.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Symptoms and Causes here -->

    <h3>What causes hypertension?</h3>
    <p>Primary hypertension doesn’t have a single, clear cause. Usually, many factors come together to cause it. Common causes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unhealthy eating patterns (including a diet high in sodium).</li>
        <li>Lack of physical activity.</li>
        <li>High consumption of beverages containing alcohol.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for What causes hypertension? here -->

    <h3>Is high blood pressure genetic?</h3>
    <p>Researchers believe genes play a role in high blood pressure. If one or more of your close biological family members have high blood pressure, you have an increased risk of developing it, too.</p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your content for Is high blood pressure genetic? here -->

    <h3>Risk factors for high blood pressure</h3>
    <p>Risk factors that make you more likely to have high blood pressure include:</p>

    <h2>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</h2>
    <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk for getting life-threatening infections and cancers. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS. Once a person has the virus, it stays inside the body for life.</p>

<div id="utiDetails" style="display: none;">
    <p>A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. It can involve any part of your urinary system. Bacteria, especially E. coli, are the most common cause of UTIs. Symptoms include needing to pee often, pain while peeing, and pain in your side or lower back. Antibiotics can treat most UTIs.</p>

    <h3>What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?</h3>
    <p>UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria, often from the skin or rectum, enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract. The infections can affect several parts of the urinary tract, but the most common type is a bladder infection (cystitis).</p>

    <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
    <p>Some people are at higher risk of getting a UTI. UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum. This makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Other factors that can increase the risk of UTIs include:</p>

    <p>Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by a yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida. Some species of Candida can cause infection in people; the most common is Candida albicans. Candida normally lives on the skin and inside the body, such as the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina, without causing problems. Candida can cause infections if it grows out of control or if it enters deep into the body. For example, it can cause infections in the bloodstream or internal organs like the kidney, heart, or brain.</p>

    Diarrhea
</div>

<!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="diarrheaDetails" style="display: none;">
    <h2>Alternative Names</h2>
    <p>Stools - watery; Frequent bowel movements; Loose bowel movements; Unformed bowel movements</p>

    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>In some people, diarrhea is mild and goes away in a few days. In other people, it may last longer.</p>
    <p>Diarrhea can make you feel weak and dehydrated.</p>
    <p>Diarrhea in babies and children can be serious. It needs to be treated differently than you would treat diarrhea in adults.</p>
    <p>Talk with your health care provider if your child has diarrhea. Your provider can help you learn how to recognize and treat diarrhea in babies and in children.</p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <p>The most common cause of diarrhea is the stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis). This mild viral infection most often goes away on its own within a few days.</p>
    <p>Eating or drinking food or water that contains certain types of bacteria or parasites can also lead to diarrhea. This problem may be called food poisoning.</p>
    <p>Certain medicines may also cause diarrhea, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some antibiotics</li>
      <li>Chemotherapy drugs for cancer</li>
      <li>Laxatives containing magnesium</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Diarrhea may also be caused by medical disorders, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Celiac disease</li>
      <li>Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)</li>
      <li>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</li>
      <li>Lactose intolerance (which causes problems after drinking milk and eating other dairy products)</li>
      <li>Malabsorption syndromes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Less common causes of diarrhea include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carcinoid syndrome</li>
      <li>Disorders of the nerves that supply the intestines</li>
      <li>Removal of part of the stomach (gastrectomy) or small intestine</li>
      <li>Radiation therapy</li>
      <li>People who travel to developing countries can get diarrhea from unclean water or food that has not been handled safely. Plan ahead by learning the risks and treatment for traveler's diarrhea before your trip.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Home Care</h2>
    <p>Most times, you can treat diarrhea at home. You will need to learn:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (when your body does not have the proper amount of water and fluids)</li>
      <li>Which foods you should or should not eat</li>
      <li>What to do if you are breastfeeding</li>
      <li>What danger signs to watch for</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Avoid medicines for diarrhea that you can buy without a prescription unless your provider tells you to use them. These drugs can make some infections worse.</p>
    <p>If you have a long-term form of diarrhea, such as diarrhea caused by irritable bowel syndrome, changes to your diet and lifestyle may help.</p>

    <h2>When to Contact a Medical Professional</h2>
    <p>Contact your provider right away if you or your child shows signs of dehydration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decreased urine (fewer wet diapers in infants)</li>
      <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
      <li>Dry mouth</li>
      <li>Sunken eyes</li>
      <li>Few tears when crying</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Schedule an appointment with your provider if you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blood or pus in your stools</li>
      <li>Black stools</li>
      <li>Stomach pain that does not go away after a bowel movement</li>
      <li>Diarrhea with a fever above 101°F or 38.33°C (100.4°F or 38°C in children)</li>
      <li>Recently traveled to a foreign country and developed diarrhea</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also contact your provider if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The diarrhea gets worse or does not get better in 2 days for an infant or child, or 5 days for adults</li>
      <li>A child over 3 months old has been vomiting for more than 12 hours; in younger babies, call as soon as vomiting or diarrhea begins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Expect at Your Office Visit</h2>
    <p>Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms.</p>
    <p>Lab tests may be done on your stools to find the cause of your diarrhea.</p>
    <p>This is also a good time to ask your provider any questions you have about diarrhea.</p>
    <p>Over-the-counter supplements that contain healthy bacteria may help prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics. These are called probiotics. Yogurt with active or live cultures is also a good source of these healthy bacteria.</p>

    <h2>The following healthy steps can help you prevent illnesses that cause diarrhea:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wash your hands often, particularly after using the toilet and before eating.</li>
      <li>Use alcohol-based hand gel frequently.</li>
      <li>Teach children to not put objects in their mouth.</li>
      <li>Take steps to avoid food poisoning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When traveling to underdeveloped areas, follow the steps below to avoid diarrhea:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Drink only bottled water and DO NOT use ice, unless it is made from bottled or purified water.</li>
      <li>DO NOT eat uncooked vegetables or fruits that do not have peels.</li>
      <li>DO NOT eat raw shellfish or undercooked meat.</li>
      <li>DO NOT consume dairy products.</li>

    Cervical Cancer
</div>
    <!-- Details element with ID -->
<div id="cervicalCancerDetails" style="display: none;">
    <p><strong>Cervical cancer</strong> is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.</p>
    
    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <p>Various strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. HPV is a common infection that's passed through sexual contact. When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.</p>

    <h3>Prevention:</h3>
    <p>You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects against HPV infection.</p>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p>When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods, or after menopause.</li>
      <li>Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual.</li>
      <li>Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor.</li>

                Hello,


It appears that he has an infection causing diarrhea. In such a case, I suggest you give him the tablet Ofloxacin 200 mg + Ornidazole (twice daily) for five days after a meal, and the tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg + Domperidone 10 mg (twice daily) for five days before a meal. If he experiences a fever, I suggest him to take a tablet of Paracetamol 500 mg (twice daily) for two days after a meal, in addition to the above medications. Remember to stay hydrated by consuming plenty of liquids, including water and fresh lime juice. He should start feeling better within one to two days after beginning the medication. Please give these tablets only if he is not allergic to them. If you notice any adverse reactions, please seek immediate follow-up.

This professional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of the report or image and is based entirely on inputs provided to me. It should be correlated with clinical findings.

And we strongly advise not to take any medicine before consulting with your doctor physically or visit us at Sanyu hospital and have our doctors examine the patient plus carrying out examination

        <p class="faq-text"><strong>Hello doctor,</strong>

            I am having some queries on HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). I had protected sex with a call girl four weeks back and do not know about her HIV status. 
            I heard from her, she lost weight in recent months and also has cough. After two weeks, I got diarrhea, itching and feverish feeling. I then consulted a 
            doctor and he said it is food poisoning. I checked HIV through P24 combo test and the result was negative. Again, on the 23rd day, I checked through Rapid 
            test and result is negative. From the last four days, I am having itching, twice bowel movement, and headache from yesterday. Again, the doctor told it is 
            food poisoning. I am worrying, is this sign of HIV? When do I need to be tested again? What are the symptoms?

                Doctors Response:
            </strong>
            All call girls are high-risk group for HIV infection. Your complaint of diarrhea and fever may be due to anxiety causing increased bowel movements and increased core temperature causing fever. Rapid tests will be negative for 45 to 90 days. It is too early to have diarrhea and fever from HIV infection. Get tested for HIV tests after 45 days.

            I read your query and understand your concern.

            Vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, causing painful urination. Keep him hydrated (at least eight cups daily). If the pain persists, consider a urinary tract infection. Confirm with a urine analysis and treat with antibiotics. For vomiting, I suggest using Metoclopramide (Metoclopramide hydrochloride monohydrate 5 mg), and for diarrhea, I suggest capsule Imodium (Loperamide 2 mg). Consult your doctor and take the medicines.
            
            I hope this helps. And please remember to visit our sanyu hospital for further examination and guidance</p>

            There might be some hormone that is disturbing your abdomen and responding by vomiting and diarrhea. How long have you been on antacids? The acidity might be a responding to menstrual hormones. I would suggest the following:
            
                Have cold milk before going to bed and right after getting up.
                Include vegetables and fruits in your diet.

                Maintain a healthy BMI (body mass index).

            A pregnant woman usually has edema (swollen lower extremities) especially if she has been standing quite long. However, it is never tender but just heavy. It spontaneously resolves when she places her feet at least two pillows higher than her body or only by little elevation. In your case, we must rule out the possibility of cellulitis. Its is a condition such as how you described, swollen feet or ankle, usually pinkish or erythematous and tender to touch, sometimes warm to touch. Your symptoms are not the usual finding on a pregnant woman and must be seen immediately at the emergency room to give you first aid of a possibility of infection. It is also best that you have your blood pressure taken since the pregnant patient with edema usually has elevated blood pressure. And i hope you have already begun your antenatal visits. if not please make sure to begin attending antenatal as soon as possible. you can also visit Sanyu hospital and begin your routine antenatal visits and examination as you prepare to receive your precious baby.

                I understand your concern.

                Since your urine pregnancy test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. The delay could be because of hormonal changes due to stress and strain, anxiety, work pressure, change of place, change in climate, or low blood count. However, if you have a doubt, then get a blood test for pregnancy done to ensure that you are not pregnant. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further.

                Hello Doctor:
            </strong>
            I and my 19-year-old girlfriend had sex with no penetration but rub, four to five days before her ovulation day. She always has regular periods, but this time she had periods for just two days and had very less blood. There were a normal amount of blood clots and the color was also regular, it is just the blood that was less. She also had mild cramps which were bearable, usually, she does get strong cramps. After this two-day period, she said she has been having pain in her legs. She recently started swimming too, three days prior to her periods, and during her periods she discontinued. We did not have sex and she's a virgin. She also said that she is gaining some fat around her breast and body in general. What are the chances of her getting pregnant?

            </strong>
            I read your query and understand your concern. The occurrence of your periods is a clear indication that the pregnancy is not there and there is no possibility of getting pregnant. As far as the duration of the period is concerned as she was having normal bleeding but it lasted only for two days still it would be considered your normal period and there is no need to do any tests or to worry about the pregnancy. The leg cramps that she is experiencing after the periods are basically due to weakness or it may be due to anemia which is also causing the decreased duration of the periods I would suggest she take more dairy products like yogurt, and milk and get some exercise like raising the legs 10 times or she can have a walk daily for at least 30 minutes. She should also include in a diet green leafy vegetables along with some fruits like apples. The cause of decreased duration of the period may be due to hormonal imbalance, anemia, or thyroid dysfunction. Please get a complete blood count and thyroid profile done and review the reports. I hope I have cleared all your doubts. please you can as well visit us at Sanyu hospital and have further tests and examination

            I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing swelling in your feet during your pregnancy. Swelling in the feet is a common symptom during pregnancy due to the increased pressure on the blood vessels in the lower part of the body.

                Hello Doctor:
            </strong>
            I am a 19-year-old female, and weigh about 58kg. I have bad period pain on the sides of my lower back, which has been happening since my period started four days ago. My flow is normal, and my periods are relatively regular, but the pain has not been this bad for this long before. I have been on Panadol for the first two days and Ibuprofen today and yesterday. I have also had urethral pain at the end of urinating for the last six or so days, so I am not sure if the pain in my back is period pain or if it is from my kidneys. I have not had these symptoms earlier. Please help.
            <br>

            I am very sorry about your medical condition. I am here to take care of you. Regarding your symptoms, I propose you have developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) with dysmenorrhoea. Ibuprofen and Panadol (Acetaminophen) is not the drug of choice for such symptoms. The pain is a period pain and not the kidney, as this is related to your menstrual cycle. Please take the following for the pain and infection:

            Tablet Diclofenac 100 mg twice daily after food.
        
            Capsule Piroxicam 40 mg once daily.
        
            Tablet Metronidazole 400 mg twice daily after food.
        
            Capsule Co-Amoxiclav (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg twice daily after food.
        
        Consult a specialist doctor, talk to them, and then take the medication. If your symptoms persist, please do thorough medical exam, you can as well come to Sanyu Hospital and our doctors examine and manage you. Thanks and i hope this helps.

                Hello Doctor:
            </strong>
            This is regarding my friend's dad, aged 76-years-old. He has had recurrent urinary tract infections in the past three months, and every time the culture shows up, some bacteria, I guess, E Coli. He also strains while passing urine and has weak power (stream). He has also already taken Nitrofurantoin, Augmentin duo, and Levobact 750 mg, but the recent culture still shows E coli. He has had high blood pressure and diabetes for the past 20 years, but well-maintained fasting blood sugar is usually between 80- 100 mg/dL, and BP is usually between 120- 130 mm Hg. He does not have a burning sensation while urinating, fever, pain in the back and has never seen blood in the urine. He is currently taking Urimax 0.4, Telma AT, Amlong 5 mg, and Glucomet tablets. Our doctor said there can be some blockage or obstruction and has suggested some tests like PSA and CT Urography. Please go through the attached reports and please clear our doubts,

            Why is he always having infections and RBC in his urine? Why is it not going away after taking powerful and costly antibiotics? How to treat early renal parenchymal disease as seen on Ultrasound? He has albumin 80, creatinine 50, and Serum creatinine is 1.2 in urine. What does it signify, and how to treat it? Should we also do PSA and CTU as costly tests? What treatment do you advise?            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>
                Doctors Response:
            </strong>
            I will answer your questions. He is always having infections and RBC (red blood cells) in urine, which means whenever he is having UTI (urinary tract infection), pus cells and RBC are bound to come. Sometimes the organism is resistant to oral antibiotics, so we have to switch to injectables. Moreover, sometimes antibiotics have to be taken for an extended period, say three months. The treatment of early renal parenchymal disease as seen on ultrasound is by strict control of diabetes or hypertension as well as proper UTI treatment. Albumin can occur in UTIs and diabetics. Once it gets settled, albumin should also get corrected. Sometimes even very good control of diabetes albumin can come. Urine and serum creatinine levels are normal. Lastly, I think you should have these tests done as all pathologies can not be picked in ultrasound. 6) What treatment do you advise? If there is a recurrent UTI, I will further investigate him based on CT (computed tomography) and switch to an injectable plus oral antibiotics combination. His post-void residual urine is significantly high, so I suggest you take tablet Urimax D HS (Tamsulosin 0.4mg and Dutasteride 0.5mg) for lifelong.

            Thank you.

            I am not sure if I have asthma or not but I do think I have it. I have a medical history that includes having constant allergies and I have been diagnosed with allergic reactions to smell, chest tightness, whistling sounds when I breathe, and after physical activity, I get a cough with phlegm.

            Thank you for your query.

            I understand your concern. I understand your symptoms and they are more likely due to asthma- wheeze sound when you breathe out. But anemia can increase your problem. Practicing yoga and meditation will be of great help to you to improve your physical health and mental health.
            
            I hope this has helped you. Thank you.            </p>

                Hello Doctor:
            </strong>
            I am a woman, 23. I am 70kg. I am currently taking Cetirizine. I have been coughing badly for the past 5 months since I got my new job at a preschool. I went to the doctor, he prescribed me cetrizine drug. Although, when it gets really cold, I cough phlegm and other times a dry cough. I would like to have a second opinion on what I should do because I am tired of coughing.
                        <br>
            <strong>
                Doctors Response:
            </strong>
            In addition to Cetirizine you need to take a bronchodilator medicine that will help bring out the phlegm (Thick mucus) better. Salbutamol (Albuterol) is an excellent drug that helps widen the small airway passages and bring out the mucus. It is available in the form of inhalers. Take 2 puffs thrice daily and gradually taper over a period of 2 weeks. Whenever the climate changes or you start coughing start on the inhaler.

            Second, when there is excessive mucus, in addition to the inhaler take ambroxol hydrochloride medicine also. It is available in syrup and tablet formulations. You require 30 mg. If the phlegm is green in color and tastes bad, you may require a short course of antibiotic. It is also advisable you wear masks when you go outside, avoid cold air in the mornings and late evenings, take plenty of warm fluids (adequate hydration), use a multivitamin temporarily, have healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits. Taking garlic is helpful as it is known to have ingredients that help relieve asthma and associated bronchoconstriction.

                Hello Doctor:
            </strong>
            I had protected sex with a sex worker for the first time in my life and the last one. Can I be in contact with the virus? After two weeks I have some pain under the ribs on the left and right side, and stomach pain but not every time.                        <br>

                Doctors Response:
            </strong>
            Hi, I read your query and understand your concern. If it is a protected sex then these symptoms may occur due to other reasons. The pain in the mid-abdomen is mostly due to peptic acid disorder or peptic ulcers. Do not worry as it is not due to HIV (Human mmunodeficiency Virus) infection. You should stop eating junk food, fried and spicy food for some time. You should eat regularly. Eating habits should be proper such as eating something every three hours. Medicine: Esomeprazole and sustained release Domperidone, twice daily. Once before breakfast and once before dinner for seven to 10 days. Tablet Ofloxacillin and Ornidazole, twice daily. Once after lunch and once after dinner for five days, these medication will be helpful and please remember to consult with your doctor before taking the above medication or you can as well visit us at Sanyu Hospital for further tests and examination.
